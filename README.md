## Steps to Run

1. *Download Ganache:*
   - Download Ganache, a personal blockchain for Ethereum development, from [https://truffleframework.com/ganache](https://truffleframework.com/ganache).

2. *Install Truffle:*
   - Install Truffle, a development environment for Ethereum, using NPM (Node Package Manager). Run the following command in your terminal: npm i -g truffle.

3. *Configure Ganache:*
   - Install and launch Ganache. In Ganache settings, configure the port to 9545. This ensures that Ganache's blockchain is running on the specified port.

4. *Set Up Ethereum Network:*
   - Open Ganache and create a new workspace. Configure the Ethereum network by specifying the host and port settings. Connect Ganache to your Truffle project by setting the network parameters in the Truffle configuration file (truffle-config.js).

6. *Integrate Remix Ethereum IDE:*
   - Develop and compile your smart contracts using Remix Ethereum IDE. Ensure that your contracts are error-free and compile successfully.

7. *Deploy Smart Contracts:*
   - Deploy the compiled smart contracts to the Ganache blockchain. Note the contract addresses and transaction details from Ganache for future reference.

8. *Integrate Python Flask Code:*
   - Implement the necessary Python Flask code for backend functionalities. This may include interfacing with smart contracts, handling transactions, and managing data on the server side.

9. *Configure Frontend Connection:*
   - If your project involves a frontend application, ensure that the Web3 connection is properly configured to interact with the deployed smart contracts. Update the Web3 provider with the Ethereum network details.

10. *Install Project Dependencies:*
    - Navigate to the project root directory in the terminal. Run npm install to install project dependencies based on the specifications defined in the package.json file.


12. *Migrate Contracts to Blockchain:*
    - Deploy and migrate the compiled contracts to the blockchain by running the truffle migrate command. This step initializes the smart contracts on the Ethereum network.

13. *Set Environment Variables:*
    - Configure any required environment variables for your project. This may include setting up Ethereum provider URLs, API keys, database connections, or other configuration settings.

14. *Build and Run Project:*
    - Run the command npm run buildandrun in a new terminal within the project root. This command may perform tasks such as bundling assets, starting a development server, or initiating other build processes.

15. *Access the Application:*
    - Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost/](http://localhost/) to access the running application.

16. *Explore Application Features:*
    - Familiarize yourself with the application features and functionalities. Ensure that the KYC innovation aspects are working as expected.

17. *Testing:*
    - Perform any necessary testing procedures to ensure that the KYC process, deepfake detection mechanisms, and overall application functionalities are functioning properly.
